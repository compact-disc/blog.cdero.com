Hello, I have offically put my blog online! I thought I would replace the post the Jekyll created with something of my own to test things out. As it says at the bottom I plan on using
this website to just post about my experiences with technology. Most of that includes my data center, programming, and computer science work.

This site is hosted by me using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform. I have no idea how much this will be updated, but I thought it would be fun to try this out.
