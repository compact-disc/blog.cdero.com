Hello, I have offically put my blog online! I thought I would replace the post the Jekyll created with something of my own to test things out. As it says at the bottom I plan on using
this website to just post about my experiences with my datacenter along with other programming and/or other Computer Science related projects.

This site is hosted by me using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform. I have no idea how much this will be updated, but I thought it would be fun to try this out.
